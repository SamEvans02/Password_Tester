# Password_Tester
A repository for making a simple password tester. 




## Summary 
This is a fairly basic password tester, the features are listed down below in the next section. <br>
I made this for two main reasons: I am trying to better my Cybersecurity skills/knowledge and the ones I found online were good enough, but I thought I could make a better version for myself. <br>
Also, everyone uses passwords, so even though there isn't a line around the corner for my version of a password tester, it's still important. 


## Features 
    - Standard password testing 
        - Basic requirements for strong passwords 
    - Password reccomendations (Future: based on current user's input because I don't know anyone who uses ones recommended by browsers) 
    - Entropy calculator for the curious 
    - I could add a "Generate random" button next to the "Copy" button which generates a strong password 
        - If a user already has input in text box, randomization will use some of that. If left blank it will be purely random. 
    - I'll try to come up with more while still keeping it simple
